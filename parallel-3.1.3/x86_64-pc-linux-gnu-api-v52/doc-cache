 -- Loadable Function: VAR = fload (FID)
     Loads a single variable of any type from a binary stream, where it
     was previously saved with fsave.  Not suitable for data transfer
     between machines of different type.

 -- Loadable Function: fsave (FID, VAR)
     Save a single variable to a binary stream, to be subsequently
     loaded with fload.  Returns true if successful.  Not suitable for
     data transfer between machines of different type.

 -- Loadable Function: parallel_generate_srp_data (USERNAME)
 -- Loadable Function: parallel_generate_srp_data (USERNAME, OPTIONS)
     Prompts for a password (press enter for a random password) and
     writes TLS-SRP authentication files into the directory given by:

     'fullfile (a = pkg ("prefix"), "parallel-srp-data")'

     Server files are placed in subdirectory 'server'.  By default, a
     client authentication file is placed in subdirectory 'client'.  The
     latter contains the given USERNAME and the cleartext password.  You
     do not need this file if you prefer to be prompted for username and
     password at connection time.  In this case, you can prevent the
     client authentication file from being written by passing as the
     argument OPTIONS a structure with a value of 'false' in the field
     'unattended'.

     For authentication, subdir 'server', and possibly subdir 'client',
     have to be placed together with their contents at the respective
     machines.  They can either be placed under the directory given by:

     'fullfile (OCTAVE_HOME (), "share", "octave", "parallel-srp-data")'

     or - which might be the same directory - under:

     'fullfile (a = pkg ("prefix"), "parallel-srp-data")'

     Files in the former directory will take precedence over those in
     the latter.  The contents of the files 'passwd' and 'user_passwd'
     (if present) must be kept secret.

     This function zeroizes sensitive data before releasing its memory.
     Due to usage of external libraries, however, it still can't be
     excluded that sensitive data is still on the swap device after
     application shutdown.

 -- Loadable Function: [N, RIDX, WIDX, EIDX] = select (READ_FIDS,
          WRITE_FIDS, EXCEPT_FIDS, TIMEOUT[, NFDS])
     Calls Unix 'select', see the respective manual.

     The following interface was chosen: READ_FIDS, WRITE_FIDS,
     EXCEPT_FIDS: vectors of stream-ids.  TIMEOUT: seconds, negative for
     infinite.  NFDS: optional, default is Unix' FD_SETSIZE (platform
     specific).  An error is returned if nfds or a filedescriptor
     belonging to a stream-id plus one exceeds FD_SETSIZE. Return values
     are: N: number of ready streams.  RIDX, WIDX, EIDX: index vectors
     of ready streams in READ_FIDS, WRITE_FIDS, and EXCEPT_FIDS,
     respectively.
