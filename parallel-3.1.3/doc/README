This package contains the following sets of functions:

-- Functions for initialization of a cluster and execution of
   arbitrary commands on chosen remote machines. Please see e.g. the
   documentation of "pconnect()", "pserver()", and of the functions
   referenced therein.

-- Higher level functions, based on the lower level parallel cluster
   functions ("netcellfun", "netarrayfun", "rfeval", "install_vars").

-- Functions for parallel execution on a single multiprocessor
   machine: "parcellfun" and "pararrayfun" (by Jaroslav Hajek,
   originally in package "general").
