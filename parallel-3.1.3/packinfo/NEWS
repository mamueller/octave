parallel 3.1.3
--------------

 ** Fixed building with newer gnutls versions.

 ** Fixed building with Octave 4.0.

 ** Change formal dependency on Octave to versions >= 4.0.

parallel 3.1.2
--------------

 ** Build fixes and tests. Builds with Octave 4.4.

parallel 3.1.1
--------------

 ** Some build fixes. Builds with Octave 4.2.

 ** Links to core Octave documentation work now in html version of
    package documentation.

parallel 3.1.0
--------------

 ** Added general package documentation, accessible with function
    'parallel_doc'.

 ** Introduced dependency on package 'struct'.

 ** Fixed handling of argument and output dimensions in netcellfun and
    netarrayfun.

 ** In connecting a cluster, package version and connection protocol
    are checked. Will work only with packages from this version
    upwards.

 ** Variables are transferred more efficiently.

 ** Build fixes for new Octave versions.

 ** If cluster functions are to be disabled at configure time, this
    has to be done always explicitely now.

parallel 3.0.4
--------------

 ** Building of cluster functions disabled by default for platforms on
    which they currently can't be built or used. This enables building
    of at least the functions for local parallel computation on these
    platforms.

 ** Fix issue in package building if gnutls headers are not present.

 ** Make compatible with Octaves new exception-based error
    handling. Compatibility with old error handling up to Octave-4.0
    is retained.

 ** Fix bug for usage with 64bit indexing.

parallel 3.0.3
--------------

 ** Fix bug in package building if SRP is not provided by gnutls.

 ** Documentation spelling and typo fixes.

parallel 3.0.2
--------------

 ** Functions 'send()' and 'recv()' have been renamed to 'psend()' and
    'precv()', respectively, since previous names are used by the
    sockets package.

parallel 3.0.1
--------------

 ** Fix some issues in package building, e.g. in building if libgnutls
    is not present. Note that a libgnutls library (including its
    "development package" on some systems) which supports the SRP
    protocol is needed to build the 'parallel' package with TLS-based
    connections enabled.

parallel 3.0.0
--------------

 ** 'parcellfun' and 'pararrayfun' accept an option "CumFunc" for
    cumulative results.

 ** Fix handling of option "UniformOutput" with option "Vectorized" in
    'pararrayfun'.

 ** Function 'connect()' has been renamed to 'pconnect()' since the
    previous name is used by the control package.

 ** New functions 'netcellfun' and 'netarrayfun' for remote parallel
    execution.

 ** New convenience function 'rfeval' for single remote function
    execution.

 ** New function 'install_vars' to distribute named variables over the
    parallel cluster.

 ** Better documentation of cluster functions. Start with the function
    documentation of 'pconnect()' and 'pserver()', and go on with the
    documentation of the functions referenced therein. The
    README.parallel file has been removed.

 ** The value returned by pconnect and the variable 'sockets' held by
    pserver, holding the network connections, are now opaque. Indexing
    the connections in this value should work as with the matrix used
    before.

 ** Connections can be based on TLS-SRP, which is now the default. New
    function parallel_generate_srp_data generates authorization data.

 ** Parallel cluster commands hanging in system calls (e.g. trying to
    read data that was not sent) can be interrupted with Ctrl-C
    (invalidating the network connections in most cases, so that
    information within server memory will be lost).

 ** New functions 'network_get_info' and 'network_set'.

 ** Within a particular parallel network, servers are supposed to be
    unique now. But a server can be a part of several parallel
    networks, and successful connection attempts of such overlapping
    networks should now be possible even if initiated from different
    client machines or client processes at the same time.

 ** Removed deprecated bw_... group of functions.

parallel 2.2.1
--------------

 ** The bw_... group of functions has been deprecated and will be
    removed in the future.

 ** Made compatible with Octave 4.0.

 ** Made parcellfun/pararrayfun a bit more stable.

parallel 2.2.0
--------------

 ** Included functions parcellfun and pararrayfun from package general.

parallel 2.1.1
--------------

 ** Bugfix for installation on Windows.

parallel 2.1.0, summary of user-visible changes:
------------------------------------------------

 ** Connections with equal hostnames are now allowed.

 ** Fix: avoids zombie processes in server if connection is closed.
