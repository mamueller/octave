## @deftypefn{Function File} {} rfeval (@var{func}, @dots{}, @var{nout}, @var{isout}, @var{connection})
## Evaluate a function at a remote machine.
##
## @var{func} is evaluated with arguments @code{@dots{}} and number of
## output arguments set to @var{nout} at remote machine given by
## @var{connection}. If @var{isout} is not empty, it must be a logical
## array with @var{nout} elements, which are true for each of the
## @var{nout} output arguments which are requested from the function;
## the other output arguments will be  marked as not requested
## with @code{~} at remote execution.
##
## This function can only be successfully called at the client machine.
## See @code{pconnect} for a description of the @var{connection}
## variable. @var{connection} must contain one single connection.
##
## If an output argument is given to @code{rfeval}, the function waits
## for completion of the remote function call, retrieves the results and
## returns them. They will be returned as one cell-array with an entry
## for each output argument. If some output arguments are marked as not
## requested by setting some elements of @var{isout} to false, the
## returned cell-array will only have entries for the requested output
## arguments. For consistency, the returned cell-array can be empty. To
## assign the output arguments to single variables, you can for example
## use: @code{[a, b, c] = returned_cell_array@{:@};}.
##
## If no output argument is given to @code{rfeval}, the function does
## not retrieve the results of the remote function call but returns
## immediately. It is left to the user to retrieve the results with
## @code{precv}. The results will be in the same format as if returned
## by @code{rfeval}. Note that a cell-array, possibly empty, will always
## have to be retrieved, even if the remote function call should have
## been performed without output arguments.
##
## Parallel execution can be achieved by calling @code{rfeval} several
## times with different specified server machines before starting to
## retrieve the results.
##
## The specified function handle can refer to a function present at the
## executing machine or be an anonymous function. In the latter case,
## the function specification sent to the server includes the anonymous
## functions context (generation of the sent function specification is
## implemented in the Octave core). Sending a handle to a subfunction,
## however, will currently not work. Sending a handle to a private
## function will only work if its file path is the same at the server.
## Sending an anonymous function using "varargin" in the argument list
## will currently not work.
